Turn an image of a chess position into a FEN string for analysis engines

This is my first python project. Currently the program takes in an image of a digital chess position and mainpulates
the image using opencv methods to divide it into the 64 individual squares. A CNN then takes thosse 64 images and 
recognizes it as empty or as being occupied by a piece and recognizes the type and color of piece. Based on those
predicted labels, the program then converts that information to FEN (Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation) which can be 
plugged into any chess analysis board to analyze the position.
